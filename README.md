# CarboKitten
**Modeling Carbonate Platforms in Julia**

CarboKitten is a reimplementation of Peter Burgess' CarboCAT, a model for generating carbonate platform stratigraphies. CarboKitten is a three-dimensional model, having two spatial dimensions and one for stored stediment.

Features:

- Cellular Automata to regulate facies type
- Advection-diffusion based sediment transport
- Designed with performance in mind
- Written with Open Science practices in mind

CarboKitten should be easy to get into and extend. All our code is extensively documented.

CarboKitten is written in Julia for performance and extensibility.

## Running

CarboKitten requires Julia &ge; 1.10. Please follow the [download and install instructions at the Julia homepage](https://julialang.org/downloads/) if you've never used Julia before.

It is advised to run CarboKitten in a dedicated environment under version control. This way, your model runs can be made fully reproducible. Create a directory for you project:

```bash
mkdir MyCarboKittenProject
cd MyCarboKittenProject
git init
julia
```

Start Julia, get into `Pkg` mode by pressing `]` and generate a new project file:

```juliarepl
(@v1.11) pkg> activate .
(MyCarboKittenProject) pkg> add CarboKitten
```

You can run the example model as follows:

```julia
using CarboKitten
CarboKitten.init()   # enables progress logging in this session
run_model(Model{ALCAP}, ALCAP.Example.INPUT, "example.h5")
```

If you wish to visualize the generated output, you'll need to install `GLMakie` first (in package mode):

```juliarepl
(MyCarboKittenProject) pkg> add GLMakie
```

Depending on your system, this may take a few minutes to build. After that, you should be able to run the following:

```julia
using GLMakie
using CarboKitten.Visualization
summary_plot("example.h5")
```

This should show a plot very similar to the one above. Don't worry if it takes a while to render. Subsequent runs in the same REPL should be a lot faster!

For more information on running CarboKitten, please read our extensive [documentation](https://mindthegap-erc.github.io/CarboKitten.jl), including the [full tutorial](https://mindthegap-erc.github.io/CarboKitten.jl/dev/first_tutorial/).

## Development

> [!NOTE]
> The following instructions are only relevant if you want to develop on CarboKitten itself.

Start the Julia REPL, and get into Pkg mode by pressing `]`. You may activate the package environment using `activate .` and then install the dependencies using `instantiate`. These steps only need to be run once.

```julia
pkg> activate .
pkg> instantiate
```

If you want to start a REPL with the correct environment already activated, use the `--project=.` flag. Use the `-t` flag to enable processing in multiple threads.

```shell
julia --project=. -t 4
```

### Examples

You'll get the best experience by running examples from the Julia REPL. There are however also some example scripts that should work stand-alone.

```shell
julia --project=workenv examples/ca-with-prod.jl
```
This command will write the output in the HDF5 format into the `data` folder. You can check that output is written there after executing this command.

However, it is more efficient to run them from the REPL. Either run,

```shell
julia --project=workenv
```

or start the REPL from VS Code. In the REPL you can run

```julia
include("examples/ca-with-prod.jl")
```

After that, you may edit an example and rerun.

```

### Global dependencies
CarboKitten has some dependencies that are only needed for developing and running examples, but not for using the library on its own. Those are specified in the `workenv` package. So make sure `workenv` is activated (`Pkg.activate("./workenv")`) or

```julia
pkg> activate workenv
pkg> instantiate
```

We have experimented with using `DaemonMode.jl` to run Julia scripts from the command line, but found too many issues with unreproducible errors. So for the moment `DaemonMode` is not used.

### Entangled
While developing, you'll need to run the [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io/) watch daemon to keep documentation in Markdown and Julia code synchronized. You may install Entangled using `pip install entangled-cli`, or use the provided Poetry environment in `pyproject.toml`.

The first time running, from the project root folder:

```shell
poetry install
```

Then,

```shell
poetry run entangled watch
```

To generate the more expensive figures (actually resulting from simulation etc.), you may run,

```shell
poetry run brei figures
```

## Documentation
To generate the documentation, run `julia`.

```
pkg> activate docs
pkg> instantiate
julia> include("docs/make.jl")
```

The example figures are generated seperately (see previous section), and are included in version control.

The most efficient way to serve this documentation and have it update upon changes, is to run `LiveServer` from the Julia REPL or

```shell
julia --project=docs -e 'using LiveServer; servedocs()'
```

The "Documenter could not auto-detect the building environment Skipping deployment." warning is expected; local changes should not trigger the building of new GitHub pages.

### Citations
Bibliography is generated from citations in `docs/src/ref.bib` using `DocumenterCitations.jl`. Citing a paper from there is done like `[Bosscher1992](@cite)`.
