# Denudation

Denudation can be applied in three ways: modelling physical erosion, modelling chemical dissolution and estimating total denudation rates based on chlorine (Cl) isotope data.

1. [Physical Erosion](physical_erosion.md)
2. [Chemical Dissolution](chemical.md)
3. [Empirical Denudation](empirical.md)

## How to use?
In CarboKitten, you could choose which type of the three you would like to apply. To do this you could simply change the `erosion_type` in the input.

Example: in examples, you find `caps_miller_diss.jl`, `caps_miller_emp.jl`, `caps_miller_phys.jl`, for chemical dissolution, empirical denudation or physical denudation, respectively. This file uses the [miller_phanerozoic_2005] (@cite) cure as sea level curve input. You could try different erosion types by changing the `erosion_type`:

- `NoDenudation` means no erosion, and is used for debugging only.
- `Dissolution` means chemical dissolution. The default input parameters are: Temperature = 273K, precipitation = 1000mm/yr, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure = 10^(-1.5)* ATM, and reaction rate = 0.002 m/yr.
- `PhysicalErosion` means physical erosion and sediments redistribution. The default parameters is erodability = 0.001 m/yr.
- `EmpericalDenudation` means total denudation calculated based on emperical relationship by Cl isotope observations. The default input parameter is: precipitation = 1000mm/yr.

## Tests for three modes of denudation
In this module, 7 tests are implemented.

Tests 1:

```julia
@test sum(denudation_mass_LOW_T) < sum(denudation_mass_HIGH_T)
```

This means that higher temperature would dissolve faster than the colder scenario. It tests the Dissolution mode.

Test2:

```julia
@test sum(denudation_mass_LOW_P) < sum(denudation_mass_HIGH_P)
```

This means more humid scenario has higher denudation rates than the arid scenario. This tests emperical denudation mode.

Test3:

```julia
@test sum(denudation_mass_phys) > sum(denudation_mass_phys_flat)
```

This means more topography has higher denudation rates than the flatter topography. This tests physical erosion.

Test4:

```julia
@test sum(denudation_mass_phys) ≈ sum(redistribution_mass)
```

This means in physical erosion mode, the total amount of eroded material = the total amount of redistributed material. In this case, boundary condition of 'Periodic has been used.

Test 5 to 7 are regression tests: the outputs from the module is similar to the values calculated by calculator.

## API

The different denudation models all follow the same API.

``` {.julia file=src/Denudation/Abstract.jl}
module Abstract

using ...BoundaryTrait: Boundary
using ...Boxes: Box

using Unitful

abstract type DenudationType end

"""
    denudation(box, param, state)


Computes the denudation for a single time-step, given denudation parameters `param` and a simulation state `state`. `param` should have a `DenudationType` type and `state` should contain the `height` property and `sealevel`.

Returns denudation mass in units of meters.
"""
function denudation(input)

    function (state, water_depth, slope)
        if denudation(input.box, input.denudation, water_depth, slope, input.facies,state) !== nothing
        return denudation(input.box, input.denudation, water_depth, slope, input.facies,state) .* input.time.Δt

        return nothing
        end
    end
end

"""
    denudation(box::Box, param::DenudationType, water_depth, slope, facies)

Computes the amount of denudation. This function is called on a pixel by pixel basis, so all arguments can be assumed to be scalar. The `param` argument should be of a subtype of `DenudationType` containing all the input parameters for this specific denudation model.
"""

    error("Abstract `denudation` function called.")
end

"""
    redistribution()

Takes `state`, `water_depth` in meters and `denudation_mass` as a 3D array (facies, x and y coordinates) in units of meters.
"""
function redistribution(input)
    function (state, water_depth, denudation_mass)
        return redistribution(input.box, input.denudation, denudation_mass, water_depth)
    end
end

function redistribution(box::Box, param::DenudationType, denudation_mass, water_depth)
    error("Abstract `redistribution` function called.")
end

end  # module
```

### No Denudation

``` {.julia file=src/Denudation/NoDenudationMod.jl}
"""
    module NoDenudation

Doesn't do any denudation: used for testing purposes.
"""
module NoDenudationMod

import ..Abstract: DenudationType, denudation, redistribution
