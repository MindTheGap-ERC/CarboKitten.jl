# Physical erosion and sediment redistribution

This method not only considers the amount of materials that have been removed, but also how the eroded materials being distributed to the neighboring regions depending on slopes on each direction.

## Physical erosion

The equations used to estimate how much material could one cell provide to the lower cells is described underneath. The equation is found in [tucker_channel-hillslope_2001](@cite). We choose this equation mainly because it specifically deals with bedrock substrates instead of loose sediments. In the equation, $k_v$ is erodibility, and the default value is 0.0023 according to the paper. $(1 - I_f)$ indicates run-off generated in one cell and slope is the slope calculated based on [ArcGis: how slope works](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-slope-works.htm). Note that the algorithms to calculate slope does not work on depressions.

$$D_{phys} = -k_v * (1 - I_f)^{1/3} |\nabla h|^{2/3}$$

``` {.julia #physical-erosion}
function physical_erosion(slope::Float64, Facies::facies)
    local kv = 0.23 #very arguable paramster
    #stencil(Float64,Reflected{2},(3,3),function(w)
    -kv .* (1-Facies.inf).^(1/3) .* slope.^(2/3)
end
```

## Redistribution of sediments

The redistribution of sediments after physical erosion is based on [van_de_wiel_embedding_2007](@cite): the eroded sediments calculated from the above equation are distributed to the neighboring 8 cells according to the slopes (defined as elevation differences/horizontal differences) towards each direction. The amount of sediments of one cell received is calculated by following steps:

## Current implementation
