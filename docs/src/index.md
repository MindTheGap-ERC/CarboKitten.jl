# CarboKitten.jl: Modeling Carbonate Platforms in Julia

[![Entangled badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/entangled-Use%20the%20source!-%2300aeff)](https://entangled.github.io/)

## About

CarboKitten is a reimplementation of Peter Burgess' CarboCAT, a model for generating carbonate platform stratigraphies. CarboKitten is a three-dimensional model, having two spatial dimensions and one for stored stediment.

Features:

- Cellular Automata to regulate facies type
- Advection-diffusion based sediment transport

CarboKitten is written in Julia for performance and extensibility.

## Julia Quickstarter

This code is written in [Julia](https://julia-lang.org/). You may want to check out the following references:

- [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)
- [Tutorial on Julia for Science and Engineering](https://www.matecdev.com/posts/julia-tutorial-science-engineering.html)

There are several ways to work with Julia that may be a bit different from what you're used to, if that is Matlab, Python or R.

### Installing Julia

The best way to install Julia is to use `juliaup` at [github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

### REPL

The most basic way to work in Julia, is to start the REPL (Read Eval Print Loop).

```shell
$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.9.3 (2023-08-24)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

julia>
```

From here you may use CarboKitten `using CarboKitten` and run any of the code inside. To work with CarboKitten efficiently, you may want to load `Revise`. Revise auto-detects changes to loaded code and makes it easy to rerun.

Running CarboKitten will require to load other dependencies, so please consult the [documentation on Julia packages](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) to learn how.

### VS Code

VSCode has very good support for working with Julia. Install the official Julia plugin and you should be good to go. Explore options by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type Julia to see what you can do. For example: start a REPL, run current script etc.

### Jupyter

You can run Julia code from Jupyter if you install the Julia kernel. Press `]` in the REPL to get into Pkg-mode, the prompt will change

```shell
(CarboKitten) pkg>
```

You may install the `IJulia` kernel with `add IJulia`.

### Pluto

An alternative (and in our opinion superior) notebook interface is called `Pluto`.

- Pluto is **reactive**: changes to code cells automatically update downstream dependencies.
- Pluto notebooks are written to regular Julia files and can (though maybe shouldn't) be run independent from Pluto.
- The user interface of Pluto is slightly less mature than Jupyter

In Pkg-mode say `add Pluto`.

```shell
julia> using Pluto

julia> Pluto.run()
[ Info: Loading...
┌ Info:
└ Opening http://localhost:1234/?secret=xyzxyzzy in your default browser... ~ have fun!
┌ Info:
│ Press Ctrl+C in this terminal to stop Pluto
└
```

### Plotting

CarboKitten ships with several routines for visualizing model output. These routines use the [`Makie.jl` package](https://docs.makie.org/stable/). Makie has three back-ends: `CairoMakie`, `GLMakie` and `WGLMakie`. These are all written in Julia, but they focus on different kinds of results. `CairoMakie` is relatively slow but results in publication quality vector graphics: `SVG` or `PDF`. `GLMakie` is very fast, renders on your graphics card, but only produces raster images, say `PNG`. Then `WGLMakie` does a similar thing, but through the web-browser.

### Design style

#### Input structures
Input datastructures are always `@kwdef`. This makes it easier to understand and modify simulation scripts.

Different components of CarboKitten can work a variety of input types, as long as their expected data members are present. TODO: systematically document type requirements for each component.

#### Output data
All output is written to HDF5 files. Optionally, you may export parts of the output data to CSV files for further analysis.

#### Partial functions
Most of the model code is written in the following particular pattern:

```julia
function component(input)
    prepare(input)

    return function(state)
        iterate!(state)
    end
end
```

In this case the `prepare()` statement is run once at the beginning of a model run, while the `iterate!(state)` statement, possibly modifying the state variable, is being run every iteration.

## Entangled

If you plan to make a contribution to the core of CarboKitten, you should be aware of Entangled.

The documentation for CarboKitten is using [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io) for Literate Programming. This means that code blocks in the documentation contribute to the actual functioning code in the library. When you develop the library code, you should have the Entangled daemon running to keep the documentation synchronized. Included in the `CarboKitten` repository is a `pyproject.toml` that manages the Entangled installation for you through [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org); alternatively, you may install Entangled through `pip install entangled-cli`.

To install, run `poetry install` in the project root, then:

```shell
poetry run entangled watch
```

Entangled is still under development and it may occur that the daemon complains about not knowing wether to `tangle` or `stitch`, for example when you've accidentally written both markdown and source code. If this happens you may manually `entangled tangle` or `entangled stitch` with the `--force` argument to decide the issue. It may be worth saving your work in version control before doing so.

A somewhat frequent occurence is that you forgot to run `entangled watch` while developing. In this case, commit the work you have done to git, then run `entangled tangle` or `entangled stitch` (whichever applies). Your files are now back in their old state, but you can `git restore` the edits you have made and run `entangled sync` again to propagate the changes. The project should be in a good state again.

### Building Documentation

To recreate the plots in the documentation run

```shell
poetry run brei figures
```

The documentation can be rendered with `Documenter.jl`.

```shell
julia --workenv=docs docs/make.jl
```

## Project structure

```

The figures from the documentation in "docs/src/fig" are git tracked, but are often regenerated when you change some of their direct dependencies. This makes switching branches harder, it would require issuing "git stash" first. We have made sure that the regenerated figures appear in `docs/src/_fig` and are not git tracked. There is a task in pyproject.toml that takes care of copying from `docs/src/_fig` to `docs/src/fig` when this repo is cloned:

```shell
poetry run brei copy_figures
```
